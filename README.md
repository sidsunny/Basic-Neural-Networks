# Basic-Neural-Networks
Simple neural networks based model to predict daily bike rental ridership based on UCI Machine Learning Database (find at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). We'll predict from historical data, how many bikes we need in the future. More idle bikes means wasting more money and less bikes than riders means losing potential customers.
